## 📌 What is MVSR Connect?

MVSR Connect is a **Reddit-style campus forum** built exclusively for students of MVSR Engineering College. It's a single platform where you can share posts, join clubs, vote on content, have threaded discussions, and report inappropriate material — all locked behind Google OAuth so only real `@mvsrec.edu.in` accounts can get in.

Think of it as a private, AI-moderated version of Reddit, but built specifically for your campus.

---

## ✨ Features

### Core
- 🔐 **Google OAuth Login** — Restricted to `@mvsrec.edu.in` emails only. No external signups.
- 📰 **Feed** — Create posts with text, images, or videos. Sort by **Hot**, **Top**, or **Recent**.
- 🗳️ **Reddit-style Voting** — Upvote and downvote posts. Hot ranking uses a time-decay algorithm.
- 💬 **Threaded Comments** — Nested replies with full toxicity filtering before publishing.
- 🏷️ **Tags** — Tag posts and filter the feed by tag (Announcement, Event, Question, etc.).
- 🔍 **Global Search** — Search across posts, users, clubs, and tags simultaneously.
- 📎 **Media Uploads** — Images and videos via Cloudinary. Images are auto-compressed client-side before upload.

### Clubs
- 🎭 Join clubs (Drama, Music, Photo/Videography, Book, Dance, and more)
- 📬 Submit join requests; moderators approve or reject
- 📋 Post within clubs — only members can post inside a club
- 🛡️ Apply to become a club moderator via the appeal system

### Moderation & Admin
- 🤖 **AI Toxicity Detection** — Every comment and post is checked by an external Flask microservice before going live
- 🖼️ **Image & Video Safety** — Unsafe media is rejected and automatically deleted from Cloudinary
- 📢 **Report System** — Users can report posts; admins resolve them
- 🧑‍⚖️ **Mod Panel** — Moderators manage their club's members, posts, comments, and join requests
- 👑 **Admin Panel** — Admins approve/reject moderator appeals and resolve all reports

### Personal
- 📊 **Dashboard** — View your posts, comments, clubs, upvotes received, and liked posts
- ✏️ **Profile Editor** — Update your display name, bio, and avatar

## 🤖 Content Moderation

All user-generated content is automatically screened before it goes live:

- **Text** — Posts and comments are checked for toxicity via the Flask microservice at `/check_text`. Context-aware (checks replies in the context of their parent comment).
- **Images** — Image URLs are sent to `/check_image`. If flagged, the image is deleted from Cloudinary and the post is rejected.
- **Videos** — Same flow via `/check_video`.

To disable in development:
```properties
MODERATION_ENABLED=false
```

If the Flask service is unavailable, moderation **fails open** (content is allowed through) so the app stays functional.

## 🗄️ Database Schema (Key Tables)

```
users              → id, name, email, google_id, picture, role, bio
posts              → id, title, content, author_id, author_name, media_url, media_type, club_id, created_at
comments           → id, content, post_id, user_id, parent_comment_id, created_at
votes              → id, post_id, user_id, value (+1 / -1)
clubs              → id, name, description, created_at
club_members       → id, club_id, user_id, role (MEMBER/MODERATOR/PRESIDENT), joined_at
club_join_requests → id, club_id, user_id, status (PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED), created_at
moderator_appeals  → id, club_id, user_id, reason, status, created_at
reports            → id, post_id, user_id, reason, status (OPEN/RESOLVED), created_at
tags               → id, name
post_tags          → post_id, tag_id
```

## 🧠 Hot Ranking Algorithm

Posts in the **Hot** feed are ranked using a Reddit-inspired time-decay formula:

```sql
SELECT p.*
FROM posts p
LEFT JOIN votes v ON p.id = v.post_id
GROUP BY p.id
ORDER BY
  COALESCE(SUM(v.value), 0) /
  POWER(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - p.created_at)) / 3600 + 2, 1.5)
DESC
```

Where the numerator is the net vote score and the denominator grows over time. The `+2` prevents brand-new posts from dividing by zero, and the `1.5` exponent controls how aggressively older posts decay out of the feed.
